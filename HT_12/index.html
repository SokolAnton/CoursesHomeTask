                            applications
                            using React and the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript
                            to access
                            your platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using
                            React
                            components: <i> bundles of reusable, nestable code</i>. You can learn more about
                            React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.</p>

                            React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with
                            JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This
                            section
                            can
                            get you started or can serve as a refresher course.

                        <p>
                            We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b> + components</b>.The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in
                            its examples: friendly,
                            approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>+ JSX</b>. React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write
                            elements inside JavaScript like so: <span class="bcg-text">&ltText&gtHello, I am your
                                cat!&lt/Text&gt.</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The React docs have <span class="underline"> a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you can
                            refer to learn even more. Because JSX
                            is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span
                                class="bcg-text">
                                name </span>for the cat, name,
                            and embedding it with curly braces inside <span class="bcg-text"> &ltText&gt</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>+ props</b>.</span> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>+ state</b>.</span> While you can think of props as arguments you use to
                            configure how components render, state is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is
                            useful for handling data that changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State
                            gives
                            your components memory!

                    <div class="text">
                        <p>
                            TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <span
                                class="ital"> onChangeText</span> prop that
                            takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that
                            takes a
                            function to be called when the text is submitted.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a
                            different
                            language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the
                            sentence
                            "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
